This year the idea was to make a 3D Maze game using the libraries infamous and threejs.

You can't do anything yet - there is too much still to be done.  
Sorry to waste your time guys.  


It is based on latest Ionic framework (3.9.2), which uses [Angular 5.2.10](https://v5.angular.io/guide/quickstart)

As always some things drag out and you catch yourself spending time on something not important and you find yourself unable to think, when something don't show any progress when you are tired.

So this time I end up with only half begun. 
But still - never mind - I found is is possible to bind to Infamous, which it does not seem is possible in AFrame (from Angular) - so something to continue with, if needed.
